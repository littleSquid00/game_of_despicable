    <h1>Dr.Nefario</h1>
    <p>
      Dr. Joseph Albert Nefario, most commonly referred to as Dr. Nefario (born
      July 28, 1931), is the secondary tritagonist of the Despicable Me
      franchise, serving as the tritagonist of Despicable Me, a major character
      in Despicable Me 2, a cameo character in Minions, the unseen overarching
      protagonist of Despicable Me 3, one of the two overarching protagonists of
      Minions: The Rise of Gru (the other being Marlena Gru), and will return in
      some captivity in Despicable Me 4. He is Gru's gadgeteer, residing in his
      underground lair and laboratories. He builds and designs most of Gru's
      machines. Gru and Dr. Nefario seem to have been trying to shock the world
      with "The True Crime of the Century" for several years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Nefario has doubts about Gru's plans due to lack of funds, and
      his new found love for his adopted daughters, he still considers him to be
      "one of the greats" in the supervillain world. Dr. Nefario also has
      terrible hearing, mistaking Gru's orders for "dart gun" and "cookie
      robots" as "fart gun" and "boogie robots", respectively. He is briefly El
      Macho's right-hand man and main henchman. In Despicable Me 3, he is frozen
      in carbonite, probably due to a Minion accident. In Minions: The Rise of
      Gru, he is portrayed as the owner of a record store that Gru goes to
      called Criminal Records, where he crafts gadgets as a side-gig.
