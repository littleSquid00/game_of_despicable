    <h1>Margo Gru</h1>
    <p>
      Margo Gru is the adopted eldest child of Felonius Gru and Lucy Wilde.
      Before she was adopted, and much like her younger sisters, Edith and
      Agnes, she was an orphan horribly treated by Miss Hattie. Like Edith and
      Agnes, Margo wished to be adopted by somebody who would love them. She is
      very disapproving of Edith's mischief, shown where Edith jumps in puddles
      which gets her and Agnes wet, and also when she breaks a vial of acid in
      Gru's kitchen. She does join in with Edith's antics if it's against
      someone she doesn't like. She finds it very endearing when Agnes says
      innocent childlike things (although she does display mild irritation at
      Agnes' fixation with unicorns), the total opposite of Edith, who finds it
      irritating. Margo appears in all three of the Despicable Me films and
      several of the mini movies.
